  abstract={Long-range interactions are ubiquitous in nature, where they are mediated by diffusive fields at the cellular scale or by visual cues for groups of animals. Short-range forces, which are paradigmatic in physics, can thus often be neglected when modeling the collective behaviors of biological systems induced by mediated interactions. However, when self-organization leads to the emergence of dense phases, we show that excluded-volume interactions play an important and versatile role. We consider assemblies of active particles that undergo either condensation or phase-separation due to motility regulation and show that short-range repulsive forces can induce opposite effects. When motility regulation triggers an absorbing phase transition, such as a chemotactic collapse, repulsive forces opposes the formation of condensates and stabilize the coexistence between finite-density phases. In contrast, when motility regulation induces liquid-gas coexistence, repulsive forces can, counterintuitively, lead to a significant increase in the liquid density.}

title = {Fluctuation-induced first order transition to collective motion},
journal = {Journal of Statistical Mechanics: Theory and Experiment},
abstract = {The nature of the transition to collective motion in assemblies of aligning self-propelled particles remains a long-standing matter of debate. In this article, we focus on dry active matter and show that weak fluctuations suffice to generically turn second-order mean-field transitions into a ‘discontinuous’ coexistence scenario. Our theory shows how fluctuations induce a density-dependence of the polar-field mass, even when this effect is absent at mean-field level. In turn, this dependency on density triggers a feedback loop between ordering and advection that ultimately leads to an inhomogeneous transition to collective motion and the emergence of inhomogeneous travelling bands. Importantly, we show that such a fluctuation-induced first order transition is present in both metric models, in which particles align with neighbors within a finite distance, and in ‘topological’ ones, in which alignment is based on more complex constructions of neighbor sets. We compute analytically the noise-induced renormalization of the polar-field mass using stochastic calculus, which we further back up by a one-loop field-theoretical analysis. Finally, we confirm our analytical predictions by numerical simulations of fluctuating hydrodynamics as well as of topological particle models with either k-nearest neighbors or Voronoi alignment.}

  abstract={We study the impact of nematic alignment on scalar active matter in the disordered phase. We show that nematic torques control the emergent physics of particles interacting via pairwise forces and can either induce or prevent phase separation. The underlying mechanism is a fluctuation-induced renormalization of the mass of the polar field that generically arises from nematic torques. The correlations between the fluctuations of the polar and nematic fields indeed conspire to increase the particle persistence length, contrary to what phenomenological computations predict. This effect is generic and our theory also quantitatively accounts for how nematic torques enhance particle accumulation along confining boundaries and opposes demixing in mixtures of active and passive particles.}
